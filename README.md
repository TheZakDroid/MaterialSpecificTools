# MaterialSpecificTools
A FabricMC mod that adds more tools - but not really. Basically tools are retextured depending on what material was used to make it.

Made a Wooden Pickaxe with acacia planks? Well, now you get an Acacia Wood Axe! Made a Stone Sword out of Blackstone? Now it's a Blackstone Sword! (Textures are also different)

Durability and strength is still the same as before, this is mainly an aesthetic mod.

Coming soon :)
